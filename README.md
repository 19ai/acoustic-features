## Goal

Develop "edge AI" on a MCU for acoustic event detection.

## Project status (Feb 10, 2019)

This project is still in development:
- All the pre-processing features and the oscilloscope GUI have been implemented.
- Several CNN models on Keras/TensorFlow have already been tested.
- Inference engine based on Keras/TensorFlow has been implemented for Win10 and RasPi3.
- Implementation of DCT Type-II (for MFCCs) on STM32 has been completed.
- Evaluation on X-CUBE-AI has been completed in [another project](https://github.com/araobp/stm32-mcu/tree/master/NUCLEO-F401RE/AI)

At the moment, I am testing the current code integrated with X-CUBE-AI.

Platform:
- [Platform and tool chain](./PLATFORM.md)

## System components

- ["Acoustic feature camera" for deep learning (CubeMX/TrueSTUDIO)](./stm32/acoustic_feature_camera)
- [Arduino shield of two Knowles MEMS microphones with beam forming support (KiCAD)](./kicad)
- [Oscilloscope GUI implementation on matplotlib/Tkinter (Python)](./oscilloscope)
- Inference engine (X-CUBE-AI with Keras/TensorFlow)

## Calibration

- [DFSDM calibration for Knowles MEMS microphones](./oscilloscope/CALIBRATION.md)

## Potential use cases

- musical instrument recognition and music performance analysis
- human activity recognition
- always-on automatic speech recogniton (e.g., "OK Google")
- automatic questionnaire collection in a restaurant
- birds chirping recognition

## CNN experiments (learning and inference)

### On Jupyter

- [CNN experiments with Keras/TensorFlow](./tensorflow)

### System performance test code generated by [X-CUBE-AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html) for STM32L476RG

- [CNN model used for this performance test](./tensorflow/CNN_for_AED_music.ipynb)

Running PerfTest on "network" with random inputs (16 iterations)...
................

Results for "network", 16 inferences @80MHz/80MHz (complexity: 340270 MACC)
 duration     : 58.069 ms (average)
 CPU cycles   : 4645555 -105/+111 (average,-/+)
 CPU Workload : 5%
 cycles/MACC  : 13 (average for all layers)
 used stack   : 352 bytes
 used heap    : 0:0 0:0 (req:allocated,req:released) cfg=0
 ```

The window size for learning/infering a musical instrument: 13.2mec x 64 frames = 0.83 sec

Conclusion:
- One core CPU @ 80MHz with 100kbytes RAM is sufficent for musical instrument recognition.
- The duration of 50 msec might be too long for key word detection. Use MFCCs rather than MFSCs to save time and memory.

Note: X-CUBE-AI still seems to generate a network_runtime.a having a liker problem for "Application Template", so I choose "System Performance" on CubeMX instead to generate code of a neural network, then remove the part of system performance test code.

### Integration with my original Keras model

I used X-CUBE-AI to generate code on my original Keras model "musical instrument recognition" that uses MFSCs. The integrated code did not fit into the RAM, so I added "#ifdef MFCC ... #endif" on the code to remove MFCC-related parts that are not used for the model.

I played a classical guitar music "Recuerdos de la Alhambra", and the result was as follows:

```
--- Inference ---
 Piano         0%
 Classical guitar 96%
 Framenco guitar  0%
 Blues harp    2%
 Tin whistle   0%
 silence       0%

--- Inference ---
 Piano         0%
 Classical guitar 94%
 Framenco guitar  2%
 Blues harp    2%
 Tin whistle   0%
 silence       0%
       :
```

## Installing the device

The device is fixed on the wall in the horizontal direction:
```
            y ^    /
              |   /
              |  /
              | / ) Theta
