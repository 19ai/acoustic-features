# Arduino shield of two MEMS mics

![](../stm32/beam_forming_20mm_board.jpg)

It looks ugly ... I used a lot of zero ohm registors to avoid short circuit, and a jumper cable to connect DFSDM clock out pin to the two MEMS mics.

## Beam forming support

The board support two MEMS mics, and the distance between mic1 and mic2 is 20mm.
