# Deep learning on Keras/TensorFlow

### CNN/DNN models

The results: about 90% accuracy has been achieved, so it is satisfying.

- [CNN on musical instruments recognition](./musical_instruments_cnn_success_1.ipynb)
- [CNN on human activity in my home](./my_home_cnn_success_1.ipynb)
- [CNN on key word detection](./key_word_detection_cnn_success_1.ipynb)
- [DNN on key word detection](./key_word_detection_dnn_success_1.ipynb)
- [CNN on my life environment](my_life_environment_cnn_success_1.ipynb)

The trained CNN model will work OK if the following condition is satisfied:
- use the same MEMS mic with the same filter setting (incl. the same frequency response) on the edge device (STM32L4)
- same environment
- less surrounding noise
- same window setting
